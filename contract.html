    <h2>How Our Service Is Funded</h2>

    </p>

    <h2>The Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We respect and protect your privacy. Dive into our Privacy Policy to see how we handle your data and, more importantly, how you can have a say in it.

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Your Content, Our Platform:</strong>When you post, that content is yours. But remember, you're allowing us to share it on VoxPop to make our service possible.
        </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Content Removal and Account Termination</h2>
    <p>
        We can remove any content or information you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies, or we are permitted or required to do so by law.
        We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your account) immediately to protect our community or services.
        If you believe your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Center.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Agreement</h2>
    <p>
        This Agreement represents a mutual commitment between both parties. Should any provision of this Agreement be deemed unenforceable,
        the validity of the remaining provisions shall remain unaffected
    </p>

    <h2>Updating These Terms</h2>
    <p>
        We may update these Terms to reflect changes to our Service and will notify you at least 30 days before making any significant changes
